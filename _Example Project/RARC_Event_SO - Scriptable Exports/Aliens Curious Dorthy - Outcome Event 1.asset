  eventDescription: You let a curious Dorothy into the Hydroponics lab.  She lays down and curls up below the big fruit tree in the center of the room and the antennae on her back pulsates with different colors, releasing some yellow particles into the air.  The particles land amongst the treeâ€™s branches, and before your very eyes, fruits rapidly grow and ripen in front of you.  It seems Dorothy has a special power to speed up food production!
