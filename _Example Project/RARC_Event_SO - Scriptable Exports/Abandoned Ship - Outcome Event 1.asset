  eventDescription: You send a couple crew on board, maintaining visual contact as they explore. The crew sees no evidence of any survivors but manage to find some useful supplies. However, the ship wasnâ€™t as abandoned as you so believed. This ship was filled with cannibalistic raiders who have lain a trap for unsuspecting spacers. You are not a military ship. You have no weapons. Unfortunately, you must make the difficult decision to cut your losses. You drive away before the raiders have a chance to attack your ship.
