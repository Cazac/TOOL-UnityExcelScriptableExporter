  eventDescription: This thing is really cute, but you know that cuteness doesn’t always mean safe around people.  You explain to the crew and the bots that this little creature is going to go to a nice farm on another planet, and you’re going to take it there personally.  The crew are a little sad they won’t be able to keep a weird creature as a pet, but having not known it for very long, they ultimately accept its fate.
