  eventDescription: The alien you named Dorothy is now the unofficial mascot of the ship.  The entire crew loves seeing her prance around the ship’s corridors, and someone has already taught her how to play fetch!  That being said, Dorothy has grown twice her size in just under a week, and with that amount of growth comes a lot of food….  Dorothy has been eating up your food supplies, enough to feed three more crew members in just a week.  Even though she’s very well behaved, this could become a supply problem.
  eventOption1_Choice: Well, Dorothy IS the unofficial mascot of the ship – can’t get rid of her now!  Keep Dorothy and continue to feed her like normal.
  eventOption1_Outcome: {fileID: 0}
  eventOption1_Requirement: {fileID: 0}
  eventOption2_Choice: Compromise - cut down the amount of food that you give Dorothy to save some resources but also to keep the crew happy.
  eventOption2_Outcome: {fileID: 0}
  eventOption2_Requirement: {fileID: 0}
  eventOption3_Choice: The fact that Dorothy grew so much in just one week alarms you.  It’s probably best to get rid of Dorothy now – via airlock.

  eventCanComeBackLater: False
