  eventDescription: On the way towards your destination, you come across what seems to be an abandoned ship. The shipâ€™s exterior gives the illusion of prolonged inactivity. There is a possibility there could be survivors on board or even supplies to help your voyage. Or perhaps the ship itself could be salvaged for parts.
  eventOption1_Choice: Send some of the crew to investigate the ship to search for supplies and possible survivors.
