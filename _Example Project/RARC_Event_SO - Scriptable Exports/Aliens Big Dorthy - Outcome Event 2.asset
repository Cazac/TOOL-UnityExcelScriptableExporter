  eventDescription: At the next meal time, you give Dorothy only a fraction of what she would normally consume.  Dorothy gets visibly upset at the lack of food, her big eyes reminding you of a sad puppy.  The crew sympathize with her and demand that you give her more food so she is happy again.  To not look like a complete asshole, you begrudgingly give her more food…. You think to yourself that next time, maybe you’ll just cut her meals down little by little and hope she doesn’t notice.
