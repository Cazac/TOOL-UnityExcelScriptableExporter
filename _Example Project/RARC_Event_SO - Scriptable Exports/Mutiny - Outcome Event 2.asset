  eventDescription: You will not submit to these pathetic excuses for mutineers. This is your ship and you know how to run it. You know better than anyone if you submit to their demands it will give unforeseen consequences in the future. You decide it is better to teach these “upstarts” a lesson before they can truly begin. You order some bots to seize their leader and fling them out the air lock, making sure to stream the event on video for the entire crew to watch. This should show them to revolt against you.
