  eventDescription: You know immediately what the bot was trying to do. It is clearly dancing. You flail your arms and swing your hips to the music. The bot stares at you for a moment. Curious to the nature of YOUR behaviour but the curiosity fades. The bot decides to dance with you. You both spend hours dancing in the night until the clock struck 04:00. You both part your separate ways. You go to your bunk to try to get a couple hours of rest and the bot resumes its patrol. You wonder if you both will ever meet again like this.
